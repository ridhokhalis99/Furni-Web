      "description": "The side table is light and small enough to lift with one hand, and the handle makes it easy to carry around the home. The handle is bent in a way that gives you a good grip and good balance when carrying things on the table. Thanks to the height of the handle there’s enough room for things like bottles and vases. The table top has extra high edges, so that things don’t slide off when you carry the side table. The clear-lacquered surface is easy to wipe clean and is stain resistant. The self-adjusting plastic feet provide increased stability. Easy to assemble without tools or screws. Max load on table top: 11 lbs. Only for indoor use. Possible to separate for recycling or energy recovery if available in your community.",

      "description": "The upholstered seat and comfortable angle of the backrest make the chair perfect for long dinners. The chair is more comfortable because it has armrests and a rounded back. The armrests are long enough to provide support when you lean back and short enough to allow you to sit as close to the table as you like when eating. You sit comfortably thanks to the shaped back. The powder-coated steel frame is both sturdy and durable. The chair can be pushed under the table so that it takes up less space when not in use. May be completed with FIXA stick-on floor protectors to protect the underlying surface against wear. Possible to separate for recycling or energy recovery if available in your communit ",
